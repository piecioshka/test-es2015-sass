# test-es6-sass

Example of test application.


## Technical description

Tried to create dummy project with `ECMAScript 6` with `Sass`.

 - I used `babel.js` and `scss` as Sass file (syntax) format.
 - I was create `gulpfile.js` with tasks with settings to `Gulp` and run! ;)


## Major tasks

 - Compile each JavaScript file (written with `ES6` syntax) to ES5 syntax,
 - Compile each Sass file (written with `Scss` syntax) to regular CSS syntax.
